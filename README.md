## Introduction

This specification defines the Nyx Programming Language.

Nyx is inspired by several technologies, including but not limited to Python, Ruby, Scheme, Swift, Rust, the ML family of functional languages, JavaScript, and Julia.

Its features include first-class functions and closures, runtime and (optional) static type checking, type inference, arbitrary-precision decimal numbers, a combination of prototypal and class-based objects, algebraic data types, and hygienic macros.

It is designed for use in both browser and server-side environments and interoperativity with the JavaScript language and libraries.
